task-manager
============
Project Bangkok develops an embeddable human task manger for Java. This task manager offers functions to assign people to human tasks and enables them to execute and control the life-cycle of these tasks. The component provides different interfaces that can be utilized by a task parent (e.g. a workflow management system) to create instances of human tasks and to provide end-users access to them. The implementation bases on the concepts described in WS-HumanTask.

Goals
* Supporting human workflow
* Supporting mobile applications
* Supporting personal task management
* Import of WS-HumanTask task models
* Integration with workflow engines like Apache ODE or JBPM fragment engine
